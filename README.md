üèõÔ∏è Jurisdictional Correction and Repository Clarification
Effective Date: July 1, 2025

I, Spencer Southern, founder and lead architect of Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC, am making this public jurisdictional correction statement to clarify the intellectual property declarations related to the Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢ framework and any associated works.

In my attempts to create repositories, I acknowledge that I lacked technical familiarity with how GitHub functions and how repositories should be structured for formal intellectual property declarations. In those efforts, I unintentionally used incorrect terminology, misapplied language, and introduced concepts in ways that do not correctly represent the jurisdictional scope, ownership, or technical description of the Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢ framework.

In an effort to correct these mistakes, I attempted to revise and add additional information to those repositories. However, I recognize that this approach may have inadvertently introduced further confusion.

‚Üí This  repository serves to officially set the record straight:

All prior repositories were created during exploratory, incorrect, or learning phases and do not represent the formal, binding, or authoritative jurisdictional claim of Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢, Reflexive Governance‚Ñ¢, Credential Lifecycle Enforcement Systems‚Ñ¢, or any related intellectual property.
These prior repositories are declared obsolete, non-authoritative, and irrelevant to the intellectual property governance or ownership structure of Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC.
This current repository (or statement) serves as the single authoritative declaration of record.
The intellectual property rights, jurisdictional standing, and sovereign authorship of the Mint-to Logic‚Ñ¢ framework and all associated works are exclusively vested in Southern Star Pro. Studios LLC.

This statement is made publicly and timestamped to correct the record permanently.
